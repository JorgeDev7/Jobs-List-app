## Job List Filter APP ##

üîß This proyect is a Challenge from Frontend Mentor, in this proyect i build a Job Listing App. I list all Techs than i use to made it. But before here's some Commands to run Development Environment.


How you can start this Proyect: 
-------------------------------
Command: npm run dev
-------------------------------


If you want to build it: 
-------------------------------
Command: npm run build
-------------------------------


üß© Global Techs:

1. Vite
2. ReactJS
3. TailwindCSS
4. JSON

‚öôÔ∏è External Dependencies

1. Axios
2. Autoprefixer (for TailwindCSS)
3. PostCSS (for TailwindCSS)

### TailwindCSS ### 

üñçÔ∏è tailwind.config.cjs is used to add the custom styles, so you can add more if you want to change a little things in the design.

### IMAGES ### 

üèûÔ∏è In the main Source, we have an assets folder, this folder have all the images that the proyect needs but you can also use another ones. 

Frontend Mentor gives a data.json file, this file has all the data about the jobs, name, role, img, id, etc. You can use it and extract the data with Fetch o Axios.

### PROPS ### 

This Proyect doesn't have a Context or Ridux. All the information is used with Props, you can see the order than de Components are created, so if you want to add some tool to control all the state, be free to do it.

### JSON and AXIOS ###

Axios is used to call the data.json and extract the info to used in the components. Be free to use another tool to do the same function.
